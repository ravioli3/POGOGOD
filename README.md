# POGOGod
The future of Pokémon GO  is here, today.

Before getting started, I wanted to give a special thanks to the Pokémon GO community of Michigan (Especially the Marquette and Big Rapids Communities) and Wisconsin (MKE Community) for all the support, inspiration, and love over the years. To all the family and friends I've made along the way and the Pokémon GO community across the world, the wait is finally over.

More information soon to come...
